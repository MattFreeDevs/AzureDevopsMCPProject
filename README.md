# MiLibreriaWebApp

Web application built with .NET Core MVC for personal library management. It allows you to register, view, edit, and delete books, as well as manage associated countries and literary genres.

## Process followed

1. **Requirements definition:**
	- The user requested an app to manage their personal library, with a 3-layer architecture and SQLite database.
2. **Structure generation:**
	- Models `Book`, `Country`, `Genre`, and the `ReadingStatus` enum were created.
	- Repositories, services, and controllers for each entity were implemented.
3. **Initial data seeding:**
	- The 100 most populated countries and the most common literary genres were added.
	- A list of books read by the user was included as initial data.
4. **Migration management:**
	- Migration conflicts were resolved and Ids were adjusted for seeding.
	- Failed migrations were deleted, leaving a clean migration history.
5. **Commit and publishing:**
	- All code was pushed to the repository with a descriptive commit message.

## What does the app include?

- Full CRUD for books, countries, and genres.
- Automatic seeding of countries, genres, and books when the database is created.
- Modern and functional interface for managing your library.
- Clean and scalable architecture.

## Note
